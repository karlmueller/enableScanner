MEng Capstone Project, MechE UC Spring 2021

Prototype code for the purposes of completing University of Cincinnati MENG 9001 Capstone.

Future revisions will likely be completed to improve the device. Currently thinking to add some more in the way of feature recognition and might change up the architecture of the physical scanner rig to allow for distance scanning via LiDAR.
